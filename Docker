# File: Dockerfile
# This file contains the instructions to build a Docker image for your
# FastAPI backend. It creates a lightweight, production-ready container.

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
# --no-cache-dir: Disables the cache to keep the image size smaller
# --upgrade pip: Ensures we have the latest version of pip
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application's code into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Expose port 8000 to allow communication to the uvicorn server
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the application
# uvicorn main:app: The command to start the Uvicorn server
# --host 0.0.0.0: Makes the server accessible from outside the container
# --port 8000: The port the server will listen on
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
